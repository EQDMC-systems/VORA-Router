# VORA Router

Shannon entropy-based task routing for cost optimization.

## Features
- Analyzes task complexity via Shannon entropy
- Routes to optimal agent tier (T0-T6)
- Minimizes cost while maintaining quality
- 80% of tasks → free local execution

## Economics
- Tier 1 (Opus): $15/1M tokens - 5% of tasks
- Tier 3 (DeepSeek): $0.14/1M tokens - 15% of tasks
- Tier 5 (Ollama): FREE - 80% of tasks
